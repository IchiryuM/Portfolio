   In the first semester's E.D. I thought about the items I needed, made them, and presented them. Students created redesigns of "the worst things we use every day" and presented posters.
They rethought the inconvenient things themselves, came up with solutions, and created prototypes using 3D printers, laser cutters, and other equipment.

      I have created an item that allows me to organize my computer cords. We were able to organize the code, but found many areas for improvement.
